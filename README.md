During this Project Jason built a virtual network that incorporated a provisioning server, firewalls, load balancers, web servers and elk stack server. The provisioning server is cool because the only way to access it is through the firewall using a secure SSH connection from Jason’s IP address. The server is responsible for running an ansible container to push updates to the web servers via YAML scripts that were fun to troubleshoot! Moving along to the web servers. These servers were running DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) that could be accessed again, only by Jason’s IP address for security. To connect to the web servers you would go through the firewall using an HTTP connection and your traffic would be distributed to a load balancer for redundancy. These web servers were fun to mess around with and as the name suggested were very vulnerable! For this project Jason also implemented an elk server to monitor the status of each web server. This web server was accessed via HTTP connection through another firewall that blocked all traffic except Jason’s home IP address.

This Project was quite fun to build out! I learned a ton about virtual networks using Azure and learned even more poking at it with nmap.
